## Hi there, thi is us 👋


### 🙋‍♀️ Welcome Home
This is a powerful Kingdom of amazing and extraordinary super heros in Open Source.

**Open Source: Where are the Women?**
It is nothing new that fewer women work in technology and by extension there is more scarcity when it comes to open source. we have come together to strive and build a community  for a better represenation 
of women where everyone feels welcome to participate. 
Currently, open source is dominated by men, as only 6% of open contributors are women — a number that is small even when compared to the total percentage 
of women in the tech industry (25%)
Our goal is to see more women contributing to opensource
